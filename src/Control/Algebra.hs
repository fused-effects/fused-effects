-- | @m@ is a carrier for @sig@ containing @eff@.
--
-- Note that if @eff@ is a sum, it will be decomposed into multiple 'Member' constraints. While this technically allows one to combine multiple unrelated effects into a single 'Has' constraint, doing so has two significant drawbacks:
--
-- 1. Due to [a problem with recursive type families](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/8095), this can lead to significantly slower compiles.
--
-- 2. It defeats @ghc@â€™s warnings for redundant constraints, and thus can lead to a proliferation of redundant constraints as code is changed.
