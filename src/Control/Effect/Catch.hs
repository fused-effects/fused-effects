-- | Run a computation which can throw errors with a handler to run on error.
--
-- Errors thrown by the handler will escape up to the nearest enclosing 'catchError' (if any). Note that this effect does /not/ handle errors thrown from impure contexts such as IO, nor will it handle exceptions thrown from pure code. If you need to handle IO-based errors, consider if @fused-effects-exceptions@ fits your use case; if not, use 'Control.Monad.IO.Class.liftIO' with 'Control.Exception.try' or use 'Control.Exception.catch' from outside the effect invocation.
