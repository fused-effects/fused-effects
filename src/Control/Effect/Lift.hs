{- | Provides a mechanism to kick off the evaluation of an effect stack that takes place in a monadic context.

'Lift' effects are always the last effect in a given effect stack. These stacks are invoked with 'Control.Effect.Lift.runM'. The 'Control.Effect.Pure.Pure' effect is equivalent to @Lift Identity@.

Predefined carriers:

* "Control.Carrier.Lift"
* 'IO'

-- | Given a @Lift n@ constraint in a signature carried by @m@, 'sendM'
-- promotes arbitrary actions of type @n a@ to @m a@. It is spiritually
-- similar to @lift@ from the @MonadTrans@ typeclass.
