{- | An effect allowing writes to an accumulated quantity alongside a computed value. A 'Writer' @w@ effect keeps track of a monoidal datum of type @w@ and strictly appends to that monoidal value with the 'tell' effect. Writes to that value can be detected and intercepted with the 'listen' and 'censor' effects.

Predefined carriers:

* "Control.Carrier.Writer.Strict". (A lazy carrier is not provided due to the inherent space leaks associated with lazy writer monads.)
* "Control.Monad.Trans.RWS.Lazy"
* "Control.Monad.Trans.RWS.Strict"
* "Control.Monad.Trans.Writer.Lazy"
* "Control.Monad.Trans.Writer.Strict"
* If 'Writer' @w@ is the last effect in a stack, it can be interpreted to a tuple @(w, a)@ given some result type @a@ and the presence of a 'Monoid' instance for @w@.
