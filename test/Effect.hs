-- | An effect to return the results of all of the nondeterministic branches computed within its scope.
data All m k = forall a . All (m a) ([a] -> m k)

deriving instance Functor m => Functor (All m)

-- | Note that since the continuation takes @[a]@, our 'Effect' instance will have to produce a continuation taking @[f a]@ given one taking @[a]@, for which purpose we use 'sequenceA'. That necessitates an 'Applicative' instance for @f@, so we specialize 'CanThread' for this effect to strengthen the constraint.
--
-- Intuitively, we can think of this as saying that if there are 'Control.Effect.State.State' effects present in @m@, collecting all of their results—joining the branches—requires us to merge the states monoidally; if there are 'Control.Effect.Error.Error' effects, it requires that they’ve all succeeded.

  type CanThread All f = Applicative f

-- | A threading effect, much like in /Effect Handlers in Scope/. Note that the 'Fork' constructor takes an action producing @()@, which therefore can’t have any stateful handlers run inside it, but could still run e.g. 'Control.Carrier.Reader.ReaderC'.
data Thread m k
  = Fork (m ()) (m k)
  | Yield (m k)
  deriving (Functor)

-- | This demonstrates that we can use '~' to define 'CanThread', enforcing the absence of state or control that would get dropped.
--
-- We don’t go as far as to define a carrier because cooperative multithreading is a bit more of an example than a test, and I don’t care to run 'Control.Concurrent.forkIO' in the unit tests. At any rate, the existence of this instance is test enough for what we’re trying to do.
